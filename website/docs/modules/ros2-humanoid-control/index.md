# ROS 2: The Robotic Nervous System

Welcome to the educational module on ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2), designed for AI/software engineers new to robotics. This module teaches ROS 2 as the middleware "nervous system" that connects AI agents to humanoid robot control.

## About This Module

This module is structured into three comprehensive chapters that progressively build your understanding of ROS 2:

1. **ROS 2 Fundamentals** - Learn the core concepts of ROS 2 architecture, nodes, topics, and services
2. **Python Agents with rclpy** - Implement ROS 2 nodes in Python and bridge AI logic to robot controllers
3. **Humanoid Modeling with URDF** - Understand Unified Robot Description Format and its role in ROS 2

## Target Audience

This module is specifically designed for:
- AI and software engineers new to robotics
- Developers interested in connecting AI algorithms to physical systems
- Anyone curious about the middleware that enables robot control

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Understand the role of ROS 2 in physical AI systems
- Explain how nodes, topics, and services enable message-based robot control
- Write ROS 2 nodes in Python using the rclpy library
- Describe humanoid robot structure using URDF concepts
- Bridge AI logic to robot controllers effectively

## Getting Started

Navigate to the first chapter to begin your journey into the world of ROS 2 and robot control systems.
