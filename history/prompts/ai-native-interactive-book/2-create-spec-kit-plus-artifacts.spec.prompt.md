## Prompt

Continuation of the AI-Native Interactive Book project setup to create the required Spec-Kit Plus artifacts (spec, plan, and tasks files) according to the methodology.

## Response snapshot

Successfully created all required Spec-Kit Plus artifacts for the AI-Native Interactive Book project:
1. Updated the constitution file at .specify/memory/constitution.md with project-specific principles
2. Created spec file at specs/ai-native-interactive-book/spec.md with detailed user stories, requirements, and success criteria
3. Created plan file at specs/ai-native-interactive-book/plan.md with technical context, architecture, and project structure
4. Created tasks file at specs/ai-native-interactive-book/tasks.md with organized, prioritized implementation tasks following the Spec-Kit Plus methodology

All artifacts align with the project's core principles of spec-driven development, accuracy and content grounding, reusable AI intelligence, personalization-first design, and production-grade architecture.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created complete Spec-Kit Plus artifact set for AI-Native Interactive Book project
- 🧪 Tests: No automated tests for documentation artifacts
- 📁 Files: Created spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md and updated constitution.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: Begin implementation following the created tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: All Spec-Kit Plus artifacts properly created according to template structures and project requirements

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Start implementing tasks following the created task list
