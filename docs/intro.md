# Introduction to ROS 2: The Robotic Nervous System

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2), designed for AI/software engineers new to robotics. This educational module teaches ROS 2 as the middleware "nervous system" that connects AI agents to humanoid robot control.

## About This Guide

This guide is structured into three comprehensive chapters that progressively build your understanding of ROS 2:

1. **[ROS 2 Fundamentals](./modules/ros2-humanoid-control/chapter-1-ros2-fundamentals.md)** - Learn the core concepts of ROS 2 architecture, nodes, topics, and services
2. **[Python Agents with rclpy](./modules/ros2-humanoid-control/chapter-2-python-agents-rclpy.md)** - Implement ROS 2 nodes in Python and bridge AI logic to robot controllers
3. **[Humanoid Modeling with URDF](./modules/ros2-humanoid-control/chapter-3-urdf-modeling.md)** - Understand Unified Robot Description Format and its role in ROS 2

## Target Audience

This guide is specifically designed for:
- AI and software engineers new to robotics
- Developers interested in connecting AI algorithms to physical systems
- Anyone curious about the middleware that enables robot control

## Prerequisites

Before diving into this material, you should have:
- Basic knowledge of Python programming
- Understanding of distributed systems concepts (helpful but not required)
- Familiarity with Linux command line (for development)

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this guide, you will be able to:
- Understand the role of ROS 2 in connecting AI agents to robot control systems
- Create ROS 2 nodes in Python using the rclpy library
- Explain how nodes, topics, and services enable message-based robot control
- Describe humanoid robot structure using URDF concepts
- Bridge AI logic to robot controllers effectively

## Getting Started

Begin with the first chapter to learn about ROS 2 fundamentals, or jump to any section that interests you most. Each chapter is designed to be comprehensive but also builds on the previous material.
